# ED-ML

The **ed-ml** repository was created to develop the **ed_ml package** that will be leveraged to run the end-to-end Machine Learning challenge presented by EdMachina.

The **ed-ml** package can be used to:
- Run **data processing** jobs
- Run **model tuning** jobs
- Manage a ML model **repository**
- **Serve** models than can be consumed through an endpoint
- Run new **inferences** programatically
- Interact with the solution through a **web-app**

## Installation
----------------------
    
1. Create python virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
2. Install ed_ml module in "editable" mode:
```
pip install -e .
```
3. Install & run the [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) application.
4. Set the `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to pull images from the `ed-ml-docker` dockerhub repository:
```bash
export VARIABLE_NAME=token

```


## Usage
----------------------

#### Quick Start

The most straight-forward way to interact with the solution is through the **Streamlit web-app**. To do so, run the following commands:
```
chmod +x ./scripts/bash/image_building.sh
```
```
./scripts/bash/image_building.sh
```

This will run the `run_app.sh` bash script, which will:
- Log in to the `ed-ml-docker` dockerhub repository
- pull the `model_serving_v1.0.0` & `app_v1.0.0` docker images

Finally, open the web-app through the url: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

`TODO`:
- [x] Add docstrings using copilot
- [ ] Create diagrams
- [ ] add docker image for model
- [ ] Complete README.md
